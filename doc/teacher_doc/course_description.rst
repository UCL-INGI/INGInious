Course description files
------------------------

The course description is a YAML file named ``course.yaml`` containing all the course parameters used by INGInious.
Here is a simple course description.

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: "[DEMO] Demonstration course"
    admins:
    - demouser

This elementary course description file will make a new publicly visible course appear as
*[DEMO] Demonstration course* on the course list.

Inside the task folder, courses are identified by subdirectories name by their course id and containing a ``course.yaml``
file. For instance, this file, for a course with id ``courseid1``, should be placed in a ``courseid1`` subdirectory.

``course.yaml`` is a YAML file containing the course configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    admins:
      - demouser
    name: "[DEMO] Demonstration course"
    groups_student_choice: false
    accessible: true
    registration: true
    registration_password: null
    registration_ac: null

While the ``course.yaml`` file must be present at the course root dir, all the fields inside are actually only used by
the webapp. Here are the possible fields to set:

- ``name``
  Displayed name of the course on the course list.

- ``admins``
  List of administrators usernames. These users will have complete administrations right on the course.

- ``accessible``
  When this field is defined, the course is only visible if within the defined period.
  A course is always accessible to its admins, and is only hidden to normal users,
  even if they are registered to the course.
  This field can contain theses values:

  ``true``
      the task is always accessible;
  ``false``
      the task is never accessible;
  ``"<start>/<end>"``
      where <start> and <end> are either empty or valid dates like "2014-05-10 10:11:12" or "2014-06-18".
      The task is only accessible between <start> and <end>.
      If one of the values is empty, the corresponding limit does not apply.

      Dates are always considered as a precise instant (to te lowest resolution of the clock).
      For example, "2014-05-21" is expanded to "2014-05-21 00:00:00".
      This means that start limits are inclusive, while end limits are exclusive.

      Some examples::

          "2014-05-21 / 2014-05-28"
          "/ 2014-01-01 " # (strictly) before january the first
          "2030-01-01 /" # opens in 2030
          "/" # Always open
          "/ 2013-12-31 23:59:59" # closes one minute before "/ 2014-01-01"

- ``registration``
  When this field is defined, users can only register to the course between the defined period.
  It takes the same arguments as ``accessible``.

- ``allow_unregister``
  If this field is defined and set to ``false``, then students are not allowed to auto-unregister from the course.

- ``registration_password``
  A password that is asked upon registration to the course. If empty or not defined, no password will be asked.

- ``registration_ac``
  Access control (AC) method. Can be ``null`` (anyone can register), ``username`` (filter by username), ``binding``
  (filter by binding auth method) or ``email`` (filter by email address). If AC is activated, the allowed values for the filter
  should be set in the ``registration_ac_list`` key.

- ``registration_ac_list``
  If AC is activated, ``registration_ac_list`` should contain a list of values for the filter.
  ``*`` acts as a wildcard.

- ``nofrontend``
  If this field is defined and set to ``true``, then the course won't be displayed on the webapp course list.

- ``groups_student_choice``
  If this field is defined and set to ``true`` and if collaborative work is activated for a given task, students will be
  invited to register by themselves for a group before submitting.
