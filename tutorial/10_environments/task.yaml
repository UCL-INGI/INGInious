            You have now reached the end of this tutorial and should be able to design assignments using INGInious. Some things remain uncovered like natch jobs and plugins. Those are advanced features for the superadministrator; please refer to the complete documentation.

            In this last section you'll find out how to add some environments to your INGInious installation. Indeed, our default environment only provides Python 2/3 along with some standard command-line tools. **Please note that this is only accessible to the superadministrator, who has access to the INGInious installation.**

        Some environments based on free and open source software are provided by the INGInious authors:

        :``default``:
            Default Python 2/3 environment.
        :``cpp``:
            Includes GCC toolchain for C/C++ development.
        :``java7``:
            Includes Java 7 and JUnit.
        :``java8scala``:
            Includes Java 8 and Scala.
        :``math``:

        INGInious supported environments are available through the Docker hub, and can be downloaded via the following command on your INGInious instances:

        .. code-block:: shell

            docker pull ingi/inginious-c-ENVIRONMENT_NAME

        Then, restart the INGInious agent in order to see the new environment on the environment list.

    Custom environments
    -------------------

    .. class:: text-justify

        All INGInious environment containers inherits from the ``ingi/inginious-c-base`` container which provides the INGInious API on CentOS distribution. To define a new environment, you'll need to:

        - Define a Docker container that inherits from ``ingi/inginious-c-base`` using a ``Dockerfile``.
        - Name the environment using the ``org.inginious.grading.name`` label.

        For instance, these basic ``Dockerfile`` will provide you with GCC for C/C++ development with environment name ``cpp``:

        .. code-block::

            FROM  ingi/inginious-c-base
            LABEL org.inginious.grading.name="cpp"
            RUN   yum install -y gcc cpp make binutils libstdc++ && yum clean all

        This new container can be built and used inside INGInious (after INGInious restart) by using the following command:

        .. code-block:: shell

            docker build -t ingi/inginious-c-ENVIRONMENT_NAME FOLDER_TO_DOCKERFILE
