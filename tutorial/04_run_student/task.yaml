            The next sections of this tutorial will help you interfacing your test suite with INGInious.

            In the *Getting started* section of this tutorial, you were asked to provide a small Python program printing ``Hello World!`` on standard output. The grading script was the following one:

            .. code-block:: bash

                #!/bin/bash

                getinput "thecode" > student/student_code.py
                output=$(python3 student/student_code.py)

                if [ "$output" = "Hello World!" ]; then
                    feedback-result success
                else
                    feedback-result failed
                    feedback-msg -em "Your program displayed : $output"
                fi

        .. container:: col-md-2 text-center

            .. raw:: html

               <i style="font-size:120px;" class="fa fa-shield"></i>

    Breaking the grading script
    ---------------------------

    .. class:: text-justify

        The grading script shown above will execute the grading code and student-provided code in the same context. An alert student who knows how the INGInious API interact between the grading script and the submission manager may try to open several new processes to change its own result.

        For instance, this grading script is particularly sensible on the ``feedback-grade`` and ``feedback-msg`` API (discussed later). Try again mission *1. Getting started* with this simple code and observe the result:

        .. code-block:: python

            import os
            print("Hello World!")
            os.system("feedback-msg -em 'You have made it.' ")

        Moreover, students are also able to modify grading scripts that would not yet be loaded at the time their code is executed. One can easily conclude that a badly written grading script may leave the student with total control on how (s)he's graded, requiring the teaching staff to read manually all the submissions to detect fraud.

    The ``run_student`` API
    -----------------------
    .. class:: text-justify

        To ensure the student has no access to your grading scripts or the INGInious interface, a specific ``run_student`` API is provided.

        This tool is used to add a layer of isolation by spawning a process in a new container which possibly has overriden limitations and has only access to the ``student`` task subdirectory. This is known as the *student container*, in contrast to the *grading container*.

    Using the API
    ``````````````
    .. class:: text-justify

        The ``run_student`` API is a *grading container*-accessible shell command that takes as positional argument the shell command to launch inside the *student container*, as well as the following optional parameters:

        --container CONTAINER
            Name of the environment to use. The default is the same as the current environment.

        --time TIMEOUT_VALUE
            Timeout (CPU time) for the container. The default is the same as the grading container.

        --hard-time TIMEOUT_VALUE
            Hard timeout for the container (wall time). The default is three times the value indicated for ``--time``.

        --memory MEMORY
            Maximum memory for the container, in MB. The default is the same as the current container.

        --share-network
            Share the network stack of the grading container with the student container. This is not the case by default.


        It forwards standard I/O, most signals and returns specific additional exit codes:

        - ``252`` : *student container* killed due to an out-of-memory
        - ``253`` : *student container* timed out
        - ``254`` : I/O redirection failed

    Adapting the grading script
    ```````````````````````````

    .. class:: text-justify

        The existing grading script can now be adapted easily. This will become:

        .. code-block:: bash

            #!/bin/bash

            getinput "thecode" > student/student_code.py
            output=$(run_student python3 student/student_code.py)

            if [ "$output" = "Hello World!" ]; then
                feedback-result success
            else
                feedback-result failed
                feedback-msg -em "Your program displayed : $output"
            fi

        Please note that the *student container* will be started with the same working directory as the *grading container*. You may need to change it to ``/student`` before to allow students to perform IO in the working directory.

    Retry to break the code
    ```````````````````````
    .. class:: text-justify

        The current task ``run`` script has been corrected to reflect the need for student process isolation. Try to break the grading script again !
