          Welcome on the INGInious platform ! INGInious is an automatic grading platform mainly designed for coding-like assignments and widely extensible.

          It allows to run any kind of test with any kind of software in secure environments, and to provide students with feedback on their programming assignments or MCQ quizzes in a friendly graphical environment.

          INGInious comes with a *micro LMS* (webapp) that allows storing and managing/restricting student submissions, producing statistics, and provides grouped submissions facilities such as teams or classrooms with up to two levels of hierarchy.

        If you already rely on an existing LMS such as Moodle or edX, you can integrate the INGInious grading features using our LTI interface and keep using your now-augmented existing e-learning platform.

        According to your role in a course, you may see things a bit differently on this page:


        - **Student**: Below you'll find the questions to answer to succeed this mission. Once you've answered to all the questions, click on *Submit*. No submission limit or deadline is set on this mission. Your score for this mission is, by default, the best one you've submitted.
        - **Tutor/teaching assistant**: You then have read access to submissions made by registered students by clicking on *View submissions*.
        - **(Super-)Administrator**: If a deadline or submission limit is set, this won't apply to you. You can change the parameters and edit the test files by clicking on *Edit Task*. An additional button is available next to the *Submit* button. This button allows you to get an SSH remote access to your secure grading environment.

    Hello World!
    ------------

    This basic introduction task aims at getting you familiar with the INGInious submission interface.

    Your mission
    ````````````

    In this mission, you'll have to use the Python 3 built-in ``print`` function to display an ``Hello World!`` message on the console.

    How is this checked ?
    `````````````````````

    Each INGInious programming assignment tests are started using the task ``run`` script, which can be any executable file. This mission is evaluated using the following ``run`` script :

    .. code:: bash

        #!/bin/bash

        getinput "thecode" > student/student_code.py
        output=$(python3 student/student_code.py)

        if [ "$output" = "Hello World!" ]; then
            feedback-result success
        else
            feedback-result failed
            feedback-msg -em "Your program displayed : $output"
        fi

    This fetches the ``thecode`` problem content and stores it in a ``student/student_code.py`` file. It then checks if the program output is ``Hello World!`` or prints a feedback message with the actual program output.

            Here you are asked to provide a basic Python 3 program displaying ``Hello World!`` on standard output.

            *Hint :* to display something on standard output, use the built-in ``print`` method.
